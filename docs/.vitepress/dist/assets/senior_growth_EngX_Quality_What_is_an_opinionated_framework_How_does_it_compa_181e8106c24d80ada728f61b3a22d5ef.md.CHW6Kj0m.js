It often comes with pre-defined conventions, patterns, and practices that guide the developer in how to organize and develop the application. These frameworks aim to streamline development by offering a &quot;one right way&quot; to build the application.</p><p>In an opinionated framework, many choices (like how the file system is structured, how routing is handled, how to manage state, and which libraries to use) are predefined, and developers are encouraged (or required) to follow these guidelines.</p><h3 id="examples-of-opinionated-frameworks" tabindex="-1"><strong>Examples of Opinionated Frameworks:</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-opinionated-frameworks" aria-label="Permalink to “Examples of Opinionated Frameworks:”">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>: Provides conventions for file structure, database management, routing, and more.</li><li><strong>Next.js</strong> (in the React ecosystem): Prescribes the use of certain patterns for routing, data fetching, and file-based structure.</li><li><strong>Angular</strong>: Enforces the use of TypeScript, a modular structure with specific practices for dependency injection, component organization, etc.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="what-is-a-non-opinionated-framework" tabindex="-1"><strong>What is a &quot;Non-Opinionated&quot; Framework?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-non-opinionated-framework" aria-label="Permalink to “What is a &quot;Non-Opinionated&quot; Framework?”">​</a></h3><p>A <strong>non-opinionated framework</strong> (also called &quot;unopinionated&quot;) is more flexible and gives developers the freedom to structure and organize the application as they see fit.
