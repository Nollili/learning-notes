Each of these smaller applications (micro frontends) can be developed, deployed, and maintained by different teams, potentially with different technologies and frameworks, while still being part of the same overall application.</p><p>The concept of <strong>Micro Frontends</strong> extends the principles of <strong>Microservices</strong> (which break back-end monoliths into smaller services) to the front-end world, making it easier to manage complex applications by enabling modularization and decoupling.</p><hr><h3 id="key-concepts-of-micro-frontends" tabindex="-1"><strong>Key Concepts of Micro Frontends</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts-of-micro-frontends" aria-label="Permalink to “Key Concepts of Micro Frontends”">​</a></h3><ol><li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: Just as microservices break up the back end, micro frontends break up the UI. Each micro frontend can be responsible for a particular feature or page of the application.</li><li><strong>Independent Deployments</strong>: Micro frontends are deployed independently, allowing each team to release updates without having to wait for other parts of the system to be updated.</li><li><strong>Technology Agnostic</strong>: Teams can choose their preferred tools, frameworks, or libraries for their micro frontend. For instance, one part of the UI could be built with <strong>React</strong>, while another might be built with <strong>Vue.js</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong>.</li><li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Each micro frontend is responsible for its own functionality, state, and UI, and communicates with other parts of the application through defined interfaces or APIs.</li><li><strong>Single Page Application (SPA)</strong>: The end product still feels like a single-page application (SPA) for the user, but it is composed of multiple smaller frontends working together.</li></ol><hr><h3 id="how-micro-frontends-work" tabindex="-1"><strong>How Micro Frontends Work</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-micro-frontends-work" aria-label="Permalink to “How Micro Frontends Work”">​</a></h3><p>Micro frontends allow you to split your large front-end codebase into several smaller, self-contained units.

One team could use React, while another could use Vue or Angular, without causing conflicts.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Independent Deployment</strong>: <ul><li>Each micro frontend can be deployed independently, which reduces the coordination overhead that comes with deploying monolithic applications.

Optimization strategies, like code splitting and lazy loading, must be employed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consistency in UI/UX</strong>: <ul><li>Since different teams may use different frameworks or libraries, ensuring consistent design and user experience across all micro frontends is a challenge. It requires careful planning and a shared design system.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Shared State Management</strong>: <ul><li>Managing state across multiple micro frontends can be tricky. The lack of a central state store might lead to issues in data synchronization and communication between micro frontends. Solutions like <strong>Redux</strong> or <strong>custom events</strong> can help manage state.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Increased Overhead in CI/CD Pipelines</strong>: <ul><li>With multiple independent deployments, you might need more complex continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, potentially increasing operational overhead.</li></ul></li></ol><hr><h3 id="micro-frontend-architecture-patterns" tabindex="-1"><strong>Micro Frontend Architecture Patterns</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#micro-frontend-architecture-patterns" aria-label="Permalink to “Micro Frontend Architecture Patterns”">​</a></h3><ol><li><strong>Vertical Split</strong>: <ul><li>Each micro frontend corresponds to a vertical slice of the application (e.g., a specific feature or page).

They promote flexibility, faster development cycles, and independent deployment. However, they also introduce challenges like performance overhead, consistency, and integration complexity. Micro frontends work best for large-scale applications with multiple domains, teams, and frequent releases, but require careful planning to implement effectively.</p>',29)])])}const p=o(r,[["render",a]]);export{f as __pageData,p as default};
