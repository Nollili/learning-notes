# Would you recommend javascript as first language to learn?

Subjects: General ES6+

Yes, JavaScript can be an excellent first programming language to learn for several reasons, but it also comes with some caveats. Let’s break down the pros and cons to help you decide.

---

## **Why JavaScript is a Great First Language**

### **1. Beginner-Friendly**

- **Simple Syntax:** JavaScript is relatively easy to understand for beginners. You can write meaningful code with just a few lines.
- **No Installation Required:** You can run JavaScript directly in a web browser's console, which means you don’t need to set up complicated development environments.

### **2. Instant Results**

- You can quickly see the output of your code by opening a browser and using tools like **Developer Console** or **CodePen**. This immediate feedback helps maintain motivation while learning.

### **3. Versatility**

- **Frontend and Backend:** JavaScript is used for both client-side (web pages) and server-side (using Node.js) programming.
- **Diverse Applications:** It’s used for web development, game development, mobile app development, and even machine learning with libraries like TensorFlow.js.

### **4. Large Community and Resources**

- A huge community of developers means access to a vast number of tutorials, forums, and libraries.
- Free learning resources, like **MDN Web Docs**, **freeCodeCamp**, and **JavaScript.info**, make it easy to get started.

### **5. High Demand in the Job Market**

- Learning JavaScript prepares you for a career in web development, as it is a must-know language for creating websites and web applications.

## **Potential Drawbacks of Starting with JavaScript**

### **1. Quirks of the Language**

- JavaScript has some confusing behavior for beginners (e.g., `==` vs. `===`, type coercion, scoping with `var`, etc.).
- You may encounter issues with asynchronous programming (e.g., Promises, `async/await`), which can be tricky to grasp at first.

### **2. Lack of Strong Typing**

- Unlike languages like Python or Java, JavaScript is dynamically typed, which can lead to bugs that are hard to debug for beginners.

### **3. Broad Ecosystem**

- JavaScript has a vast ecosystem (e.g., frameworks like React, Angular, Node.js) that might overwhelm beginners trying to figure out where to start.

## **Comparison with Other First Languages**

### **Python:**

- **Easier Syntax:** Often considered the easiest language for beginners due to its clean and readable syntax.
- **More General Purpose:** Used in areas like data science, AI, and automation, in addition to web development.

### **Java:**

- **Strong Typing and Structure:** Forces you to understand programming fundamentals, like object-oriented programming.
- **Verbose:** Its more rigid syntax can make it less beginner-friendly.

### **C#:**

- **Great for Game Development:** Popular with Unity for game development.
- **Structured but Complex:** Easier than C++ but still more challenging than JavaScript or Python.

## **Recommendation**

### Start with JavaScript if:

- You’re interested in **web development**.
- You want to see immediate results and build interactive projects quickly.
- You prefer to learn by doing and experimenting in the browser.

### Consider alternatives like Python if:

- You want a simpler and more general-purpose language to start with.
- You’re more interested in fields like **data science**, **AI**, or **automation**.

### **Bottom Line**

JavaScript is a great first language for someone interested in creating websites or web apps. Its widespread use and versatility make it a valuable skill. However, pairing JavaScript with resources that explain its quirks will make your learning journey smoother.
