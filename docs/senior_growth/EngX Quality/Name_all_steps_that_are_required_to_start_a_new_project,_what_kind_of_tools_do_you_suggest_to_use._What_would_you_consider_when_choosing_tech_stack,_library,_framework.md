### Name all steps that are required to start a new project, what kind of tools do you suggest to use? What would you consider when choosing tech stack, library/framework?

Starting a new project as a senior software developer requires careful planning and execution. Below are the key steps to start a new project, tools that can be useful, and considerations when choosing a tech stack, library, or framework.

## **Steps to Start a New Project**

1. **Define the Project Requirements**:
    - Understand the business goals.
    - Identify the target audience.
    - Define functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Plan the Project Scope**:
    - Create a project charter or roadmap.
    - Define deliverables, timelines, and milestones.
3. **Set Up Version Control**:
    - Use version control tools like Git and host repositories on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
4. **Choose the Tech Stack**:
    - Select the appropriate languages, frameworks, and tools based on project requirements.
5. **Establish Development Workflow**:
    - Define processes for code reviews, pull requests, and deployment.
    - Use Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban if applicable.
6. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
    - Prepare local development tools and configurations.
    - Ensure a uniform setup across team members (e.g., using Docker or Vagrant).
7. **Design the Architecture**:
    - Create the application's structure (e.g., monolithic, microservices, serverless).
    - Define API contracts, database schemas, and service integrations.
8. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Automate build, test, and deployment processes using tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
9. **Create Boilerplate Code**:
    - Set up the basic structure of the project (e.g., folder hierarchy, base configurations).
    - Include linting and formatting tools.
10. **Setup Documentation and Communication**:
    - Create a README file, document the setup process, and define coding standards.
    - Use tools like Confluence, Notion, or Markdown files for documentation.
11. **Start Development**:
    - Begin with core features and follow the planned sprints or iterations.

## **Considerations When Choosing Tech Stack, Library/Framework**

1. **Project Requirements**:
    - Ensure the chosen tech aligns with functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, performance).
2. **Team Expertise**:
    - Consider the team's familiarity with the tools and frameworks to reduce the learning curve.
3. **Community and Ecosystem**:
    - Select tools with active communities, regular updates, and rich ecosystems.
4. **Scalability**:
    - Choose technologies that can handle future growth in users, data, and features.
5. **Performance**:
    - Evaluate runtime performance, resource usage, and response times.
6. **Ease of Integration**:
    - Ensure the stack integrates well with third-party tools and services.
7. **Development Speed**:
    - Opt for frameworks/libraries that provide high-level abstractions, out-of-the-box features, and good documentation.
8. **Security**:
    - Choose technologies with strong security measures and good community support for handling vulnerabilities.
9. **License and Cost**:
    - Check licensing terms to avoid potential legal issues. Consider the cost of tools if using proprietary solutions.
10. **Longevity and Trends**:
    - Avoid adopting technologies that may become obsolete in the near future.
11. **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Ensure tools support robust testing and debugging workflows.
12. **Cross-platform Needs**:
    - For front-end projects, consider frameworks like React Native or Flutter for shared codebases across platforms.
