# What is accessibility?

**a11y** is short for **accessibility**—the practice of making websites, applications, and digital content usable by **all people, including those with disabilities**. The term comes from:

```md
a11y → a + 11 letters + y → accessibility
```

## 1️⃣ Purpose of a11y

Accessibility ensures that everyone can **perceive, understand, navigate, and interact** with digital content, including users with:

- **Visual impairments** (blindness, low vision, color blindness)
- **Hearing impairments**
- **Motor or dexterity limitations**
- **Cognitive or learning disabilities**
- Temporary or situational limitations (e.g., bright sunlight, noisy environment)

## 2️⃣ Key Principles (WCAG Guidelines)

1. **Perceivable** – Users must be able to **see or hear content**.
   - Example: Provide alt text for images, captions for videos.
2. **Operable** – Users must be able to **interact with content**.
   - Example: Keyboard navigation, focus indicators.
3. **Understandable** – Content and UI must be **comprehensible**.
   - Example: Clear language, consistent layouts.
4. **Robust** – Content must work with **assistive technologies**.
   - Example: Proper semantic HTML, ARIA roles.
