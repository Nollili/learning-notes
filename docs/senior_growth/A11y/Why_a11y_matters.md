### 1.2 Inclusive User Experience

- ~**15% of the world population** has some form of disability (visual, auditory, cognitive, motor).
- Accessibility ensures **everyone can use your product**, improving **user satisfaction and reach**.

### 1.3 SEO & Discoverability

- Screen-reader-friendly content and semantic HTML **improve search engine optimization**.
- Proper use of headings, alt text, and ARIA attributes can increase **site visibility**.

### 1.4 Usability for Everyone

- Accessibility features like **keyboard navigation, clear color contrast, and readable fonts** benefit **all users**, not only those with disabilities.
- Example: captions on videos help in **noisy environments**, high contrast helps in **bright sunlight**.

### 1.5 Ethical & Brand Reputation
